## 🚨 The Problem: The Digital Divide That Keeps Women Behind

### The Reality for Rural Women Entrepreneurs
While urban businesses thrive online, rural women face **four critical barriers**:

📵 Digital Isolation - No access to web development tools or education

🗣️ Language Walls - English-dominated tech world excludes native speakers

👵 Cultural Chains - "Technology is for men" mindset limits opportunities

🛒 Market Invisibility - Amazing products, zero online presence

*These women have the entrepreneurship spirit - they just need the digital tools.*

## 💡 Our Solution: Siyakha ("We Are Building")

We built **more than an app** - we built an **ecosystem** that transforms digital exclusion into economic empowerment.

## 👥 Our Story

We're a team of UCT students who believed that **geography shouldn't determine destiny**. When we met rural women entrepreneurs with incredible products but no digital presence, we knew we had to build a bridge.

**Siyakha isn't just a platform - it's a movement.** We're not just teaching websites; we're unlocking economic freedom, one woman at a time.
